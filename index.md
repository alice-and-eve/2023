Welcome to our free one-day workshop for celebrating women studying and working in computing!
Alice & Eve aims to bring together talents in the field of computing. The third edition of this workshop will be hosted
on **end of October 2023** by University of Amsterdam.

Alice and Eve event is inspired by the [BCS Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) that started in 2008. For more details about earlier editions of Alice & Eve, see the websites of [2020](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/)
and [2022]().

The event is held during a single day, and features:

- keynote talks,
- a poster contest, and
- an exhibition on women in computing.

Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice!

### Venue:

The workshop will be held at Lab42 at UvA science park.

### Registration:

The registration is free and includes coffee breaks, lunch and drinks. We welcome everyone of **all genders**, **from bachelor students to full professors**, to attend the event.


## Call for Posters

All women students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and postdocs of computing and related subjects are invited to enter one of the
poster contests during Alice & Eve 2023. We interpret “related subjects” very broadly – we would like to involve
everybody in the area of computing in the broadest sense. If you are not sure, drop the organizers an email and we will
probably say yes.

To enter the poster contest, please write a one page abstract (minimum 250 words) on the topic of your poster. Your
abstract can be on any computing topic you like, e.g., it can be on a topic from social networking to quantum computing;
and from medical image processing to formal verification. If it involves computers, we’re interested.

Right now we are looking for PC members. So if you are interested in helping out with reading the abstracts submitted for poster presentations, please contact us here.

## Exhibition

In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an exhibition which portrays thirty women in computing
and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:

- **Grace Hopper** who created the world’s first workable compiler;
- **Ada Lovelace** who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose
  computer, and the first published algorithm;
- **Rosalind Picard** and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology,
  Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;
- **Frances Brazier** who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.

More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition and
the [online booklet](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf).
