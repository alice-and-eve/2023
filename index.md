Welcome to our free one-day workshop for celebrating women studying and working in computing!
Alice & Eve aims to bring together talents in the field of computing. The fourth edition of this workshop will be hosted on **27 October 2023** by the University of Amsterdam.

Alice and Eve event is inspired by the [BCS Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/) that started in 2008. For more details about earlier editions of Alice & Eve, see the websites of [2020](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/), [2021](https://aliceandeve.cs.ru.nl/) and [2022](https://alice-and-eve.github.io/2022/).

The event is held during a single day, and features:

- keynote talks,
- a poster contest, and
- an exhibition on women in computing.

Join us, and participate to our poster contest on the topic of your choice!

## Call for Posters

We invite all female students (Bachelor/Master/PhD) and early career researchers of computing and related subjects (in the broadest sense) to submit a poster.

To enter the poster contest, please write a half-page abstract (maximum 250 words) on the topic of your poster and submit it by 1 October 2023 through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ae23](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ae23)

Your poster can be on any computing topic you like: from social networking to quantum computing and from medical image processing to formal verification. If it involves computers, we are interested. We welcome you to reuse any existing/published work or poster, no need to print it again.

Notifications will be sent out by 14 October 2023. Selected participants are expected to bring the poster (up to size A0 portrait or A1 landscape) described by their abstract with them to Amsterdam to present during the poster session. At the end of the day, prizes will be awarded for the winning posters in each category.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch. We look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam!

## Exhibition

In addition to the keynote talks and the posters, there will be an exhibition which portrays thirty women in computing
and their most important contributions.

Some highlights of the exhibition:

- **Grace Hopper** who created the world’s first workable compiler;
- **Ada Lovelace** who is known for her work on the design of the ‘Analytics Machine’, the first ever general-purpose
  computer, and the first published algorithm;
- **Rosalind Picard** and her work on Affective Computing which is a combination of Computer Science, Psychology,
  Physiology and Cognitive Sciences;
- **Frances Brazier** who helped establish the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the Netherlands and Europe.

More information on these women, and many others, can be found at the exhibition and
the [online booklet](https://fmt.ewi.utwente.nl/events/aliceandeve2020/booklet-13-01-2020.pdf).
